# ServerSelectorUI
This plugin allows people to transfer servers through UI
(I will make this configurable soon to allow a more customisable ServerSelectorUI plugin.)

## Details of this plugin
This plugin is currently made specifically for a server I own. I will be making this more costomisable with: Configurations, adding unlimited servers they can add, etc soon.


### NOTE
## This plugin for this branch is currently unfinished. We do plan on adding a lot of things to this plugin very soon.
