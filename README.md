# ServerSelectorUI
This plugin allows peole to transfer servers through UI
(I will make this configurable soon to allow a more customisable ServerSelectorUI plugin.)

## Details of this plugin
This plugin is currently made specifically for a server I own. I will be making this more costomisable with: Configurations, adding unlimited servers they can add, etc soon.

## NOTE
## This branch requires you to be on Pocketmine's latest 4.0.0 API update branch. We do not force or tell anyone to use the 4.0.0-API branch or api version. If they want to, or are willing to, then they can do so. But we won't ask or tell anyone to use this branch if they don't want to. We set this branch up for those that are currently on PMMP 4.0.0 update. So do not open any issue, saying "Oh, you've just forced me to use this branch", or "You're making a bad example of using the 4.0.0-API branch', and "We do not recommend those to update to 4.0.0-API". Yes, I get all of that, and they may use it as they wish, and I will give a warning here - If you use the 4.0.0-API, plugins, API BC, and your server possibly may be damaged, or issues caused by this, such as: World corruptions, crashes, or possibly lugin issues. Do not ask me to update a plugin to 4.0.0-API, as it's possible future until Pocketmine releases their update. I will make the branches for it, but I don't gaurentee they will work properly. Thank you.
