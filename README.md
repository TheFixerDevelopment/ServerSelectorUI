# ServerSelectorUI
This plugin allows people to transfer servers through UI
(I will make this configurable soon to allow a more customisable ServerSelectorUI plugin.)

## Details of this plugin
This plugin is currently made specifically for a server I own. I will be making this more costomisable with: Configurations, adding unlimited servers they can add, etc soon.


### NOTE
## This plugin is now fully stabled again! Currently, we have no plans to add major updates into this plugin. If you find any issues regarding this branch, please open an issue.

## WARNING

# This branch is for display only. We will add a branch that's for the public very soon. You can use this plugin, but don't expect us to add configurations, and everything to the public for public use. We will soon make a branch that's for public use very soon, meaning you can use it, change anything without any problems, and what not.
